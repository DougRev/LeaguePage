    <h1>League of Legends</h1>
    <p>AND WHY YOU SHOULD NOT PLAY!</p>

    <hr />

    <ul>
        <li>This game is one of the most popular games in the world and thus it has a tendency to be addicting to most people.</li>
    <li>Because of #1 this game also has some of the most toxic communities ever. More people always = more terrible people.</li>
    <li>The competitiveness of the game mixed with a toxic community hiding behind a chat box ensues frustration amongst many people.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Why are you still reading. Just delete Leage of Legends already.</h2>
    <p>Ok if you must still play then follow these steps to help your mental health and mute chat features.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open up the League application or download and create an account if you have not already.</li>
        <li>On the home screen click the cog wheel for settings in the very top right of the screen.</li>
        <li>Then scroll down to the interface section.</li>
        <li>Within the interface section you will see a sub section called Chat.</li>
        <li>Make sure the box next to "Show [Allied] Chat" is not checked.</li>
        <li>Click done and start playing and I wish you the best of luck in not throwing your PC into a wall.</li>
